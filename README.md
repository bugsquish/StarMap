Interactive Star Map POC - Work In Progress

Prototyping as part of a mobile game under development. Generates a random constellation, with a name and solar system for each star. Optimal galaxy size 10-25 stars, generate >1000 stars at your own risk. Click on stars to see the solar system for that star. Requires HTML5 Canvas. 

This is by no means a finished product and has some known bugs, but is offered as an example of JavaScript coding style. Please note use of namespaces, static objects, as well as constructors with prototype methods and scope management techniques. I have used minimal commentary but sensible naming conventions which is intended to produce code that is largely self-documenting. Nonetheless, a finished version would be commented using full Yuidoc standard.

Main application can be found in StarMap.js
